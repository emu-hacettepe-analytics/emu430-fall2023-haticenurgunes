# Assignment

My first assignment has three parts.

## (a)the differences between r and python

1-in r we use \<- symbol to assign variabes but in python we use = symbol

```{r}
library(dslabs)
number1<-6
number2<-8
my_work<-number1*number2
```

```{python}
number1=6
number2=8
my_work=number1*number2
print(my_work)

```

2-in r index of first element is 1 but in python it is 0

```         
```

```{r}

weather <- c("sunny", "cloudy", "rainy")
print(weather[2])
print(weather[2])
```

```{python}
weather=["sunny","cloudy","rainy"]
print(weather[2])
```

```         
```

3-

## b)

```{r}

data('NA EXAMPLES')


```
